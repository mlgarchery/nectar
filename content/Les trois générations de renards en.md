The poem is about a very well know subject: being sustainable, through the lens of the demography issue. 
I hope it can bring the issue to a new light for some readers.

It's a poem initially wrote in french, so it would be a lot of work to translate it appropriatly (rythm and rhymes).

However, I can describe what is said. It's organized in three paragraphs, each one of them is about one generation of foxes.

---

The first paragraph is about a family of fox, a dad and it's 6 children, easily hunting in a field.
Life is good for them as the father catch a hare and the children are playful and curious.
However, their whole world is delimited by a metalic fence defining the field surface.

The second paragraph is about one of this children being a grown up fox.
This time, food is scarcier because of the number of foxes present in the field.
It nevertheless find fish and frogs, neither are of great taste, for his own family, of only two children: Tristan and Léonie.

The third paragraph follows Léonie in search for food. The field is now crowded with foxes, and she has to fight for some mulberry.
On her way home to her burrow empty of any little fox, she comes accross Tristan.
He is reporting a rumor saying the fence has a hole in it.
