<!-- Translation: true -->

It's a poem initially wrote in french, so it would be a lot of work to translate it appropriatly (rythm and rhymes).

However, I can describe what is it about.
It's in three paragraphs.

The first paragraph is about a family of fox, a dad and it's 6 children, easily hunting in a field.
Life is good for them as the father catch a have and the children play and are curious.
However, their whole world is delimited by a metalic fence defining the field surface.

The second paragraph is about one of this children being a grown up fox.
This time, food is scarcier.
It nevertheless find fish and frogs, neither are of great taste, for his own children: Tristan and Léonie.

The third paragraph follows Léonie in search for food. The field is now crowded with foxes, and shed has to fight for some mulberry.
On her way how to her empty burrow, she comes accross Tristan, 
who is reporting a rumor saying the fence has a hole in it.
